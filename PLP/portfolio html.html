        <br>
        Two of the main foundations of my programming career have been C++ and C. 
        These languages are well known for their effectiveness, performance, and 
        adaptability, which makes them vital resources for high-performance 
        applications, game development, and system-level programming. Through 
        academic training, real-world projects, and self-directed learning,
        I have refined my C++ and C skills. With this solid base, I can tackle 
        challenging issues, improve code, and create reliable software solutions.

            My formal computer science education at MKU has given me a 
            strong basis for comprehending the intricacies of contemporary
            technology. Together with practical laboratory sessions,
            the well-organized curriculum has given me the foundational knowledge 
            I need to build systems, write programs, and work with data structures
            and algorithms. I've been able to apply theoretical concepts
            to real-world situations because to MKU's emphasis on practical learning,
            which has helped me develop my critical thinking and problem-solving 
            skills.

            <br>
            The significance of cybersecurity at a time when cyberattacks
            are growing more complex cannot be emphasized. I am dedicated 
            to focusing in cybersecurity because I recognize how important
            it is to protect digital assets and guarantee the integrity of 
            information systems. My MKU education and own research on 
            cybersecurity concepts have prepared me for this focus.
             I'm interested in topics like network 
             security, encryption, and ethical hacking, 
             and I'm excited to help shield private information from bad actors.
